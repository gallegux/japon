Oracle removed support for JNLP applications, I think Java9 no longer executes those files.

Why? Their reasons would have and I suppose they will be documented, but I neither know nor have I looked for them. In any case, if Oracle says no, it's not.

As I liked the idea of JNLP I have created a successor: JAPON, Java Application Over Net. Maybe "Over" is not grammatically correct (maybe "On"?), I am not good at English. In any case JAPON sounds good :) and it has meaning in Spanish.

How it works?

JAPAN enables an application to be launched on a client desktop by using resources that are hosted on web servers.
Those resources will be downloaded to the client computer the first time and stored in a cache. The next times that resource is needed it will not be downloaded unless it has been updated.

If you are interested in using it, write me an email.
